- Pick a theme
- Gather all of the required sounds. (Preferably in format that works on FF Fedora
                                      if you can only find an mp3 then whatever.)
- Upload all of the sounds and link them to the corresponding button.
- Create Header/title/description
- Place and order the buttons in a logical way
- Allow users to cancel sounds as they're playing (optional)
- Styling
- Switch to a JS toolchain instead of plain HTML tag setup if necessary.
